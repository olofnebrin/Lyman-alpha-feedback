### Purpose of repository

This repository contains files related to the following paper on Lyman-α (Lyα) feedback (Nebrin+ 2024 for short below):

[Nebrin et al. (2024), *Strong Lyman-α feedback at Cosmic Dawn: Implications for the first stars and galaxies, star clusters, and direct-collapse black holes*](INSERT_LINK_HERE).

Authors & contributors: Olof Nebrin, Aaron Smith, Kevin Lorinc, Johan Hörnquist, and Åsa Larsson. 

### Description of files

The folder M_fit contains a Python and Julia implementation of the fit to the Lyα force multiplier, as given the paper, as well as related quantities 
(e.g. the destruction probability). An example plot is included too. If you use these fits or results in your work, please cite Nebrin+ (2024).
